approval-tests-setup
===
An example project using CMake's ```FetchContent``` module with ApprovalTests.

Dependencies
---
A fairly recent version of [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) is required, at least 3.14.
[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is also required for CMake to fetch other dependencies.
This project defaults to using the C++14 standard and a compliant compiler is recommended.

Build
---
A standard CMake install should build this project.
Please note that the Ninja generator is not supported by the ApprovalTests Catch2 integration.
The test will fail if Ninja is used as the build generator.
Otherwise, the following example code should build without for any single-configuration generator.
```bash
mkdir build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
A multi-configuration generator must specify the configuration of the build.
The following command specifies the *Release* configuration.
```bash
cmake --build . --config Release
```

Run
---
The tests can be run by simply invoking CTest in the build directory.
```bash
ctest
```

---
This project is not currently meant to be installed.
